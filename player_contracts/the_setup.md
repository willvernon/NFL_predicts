# Building a simple C++ tui app to predict NFL player contracts

## Initial-Model Guidelines:

Simple Model,

- 40 points max for ability,
- 20 for contract,
- 20 for age, and 20 for injuries,
- docking 5 per issue for now.

Code that up in C++, get the TUI asking for inputs, and see what it predicts. Once it’s humming, you can spice it up with injury specifics later.

## TUI - FTXUI
